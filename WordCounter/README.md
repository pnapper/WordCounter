 ## Description

 A website in MVC that uses a method to return how frequently a word appears in a given string. The user should input both the word and the string of words to check. The website checks for full word matches only.

 ## Specifications

 * 1. User inputs the string word and the string sentence containing just the string word. This is the simplest test to see that the string sentence input is being compared correctly to the string word input, is recognizing a match and returning a word count of 1.

  Sample Input: "run" and "run"
  Sample Output: 1

 * 2. User inputs a string word and a string sentence with only one word that does not contain the string word.

  Sample Input: "run" and "jog"
  Sample Output: 0

 * 3. User inputs a string word and a multiple word sentence with punctuation containing the string word.

  Sample Input: "run" and "See Jane run."
  Sample Output: 1

 * 4. User inputs a string word and a multiple word sentence with punctuation containing multiples of the string word.

  Sample Input: "run" and "See Jane run and run."
  Sample Output: 2
